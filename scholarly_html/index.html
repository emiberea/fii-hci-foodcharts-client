        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The project that we are describing in this paper is called "FoodCharts" and it is implemented
            for the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/index.html">Human-Computer Interaction course</a>
            held by Dr. Sabin-Corneliu Buraga at Faculty of Computer Science, “Al.I.Cuza” University, Iasi, in the second
            semester of the 2015-2016 school year, and developed by the 2nd year MA students Berea Emanuel-Vasile
            and Serseniuc Simona-Ecaterina.

        <h2>Motivation and Objectives</h2>
        <aside typeof="schema:WPSideBar">
            <p>
                At the beginning of the semester we had to choose one project from the
                <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/projects/">project proposals list</a>
                that is available on the course page. After a discussion regarding our option we decided
                to go with the "Visualious" project as we find the requirements very interesting. The
                project description reads:
            <blockquote cite="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/projects/" property="schema:citation">
                "Propose interesting means of complex visualization and faceted navigation concerning the information
                provided by various <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">online sources of
                public datasets</a>.
                Consider different interaction techniques/contexts concerning at least two classes of users,
                software and hardware platforms, displays, and devices."
            </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>
            We organized our work, as required in the <a
                href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/hci-projects.html">project requirements
            page</a>,
            and we created a <a href="http://foodcharts.vrinceanu.com/">blog</a> where we can track the progress
            of the work.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main idea of the project is to create an application which allows the users to visualize
            data in appealing way. The purpose of the project is not to provide a 100% working solution,
            but to apply "Human-Computer Interaction" principles in order to create an application which
            will suit the targeted user in every possible way.

        <h2>Etymology and Branding</h2>
        <section id="name-and-etymology">
            <h3>Name and Etymology</h3>
            <p>
                Our first idea for the name was “Visualicious” – Visual + Delicious. Because we like seeing
                data in appealing ways. But this name was taken by a graphic designer and we won’t like our
                identities to be mistaken.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second idea was “Visualistique” – Visual + Majestique. Based on the same principle as
                “Visualicious”, but with a different adjective.
            </p>
            <p>
                After founding mostly of our data that we are going to use, we agreed that our application
                should be based on data about food. We did a long research and debate about what we should
                finally name our application, and finally we decided to name it “FoodCharts”. We think that
                it emphasize very close the application domain and what it wants to accomplish.
            </p>

        <section id="logo">
            <h3>Logo</h3>
            <p>
                This is the logo that we created:
            </p>
            <figure typeof="sa:Image">

            </figure>
            <p>
                We used a metaphor by using a chart icon instead of the “h” letter and regarding the
                font we decided to use “<a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fenix">Fenix</a>“. About the
                color scheme we used just one color and we chose
                “Teal” Color palette from <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html">Google material
                design documentation</a>. #009688 color.

            <h3>Color scheme and Typography</h3>
            <p>For the color scheme we decided to create a simple and clean design, so we will use the mono option,
                which will be based on the “Teal” Color palette, same as the logo. About the typography we will use "<a
                        href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro">Source Sans Pro</a>" font, with a
                3:4 scale. The leading will start at 1.25 for a 16px font size and it will be increased with 0.25 at
                every 4px for font size. Below we have our style tile:</p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
            Another requirement for this project is to do user research and create personas profiles for the possible users.
            We used the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/personas/">template</a> that was provided on
            the course page. We reviewed what type of user could be interested in using our application, and decided that
            it should be a person who is interested about the nutritional values that the ingredients from the food contains.
            Possible users could be: cooks, students at faculties about chemistry and food research, or people who may
            have health problems and they want to follow a diet. We used the personas methodology and created profiles
            for Primary/Secondary/Negative users. Our final personas template is available on this
            <a href="http://foodcharts.vrinceanu.com/info/personas/personas.html">page</a> from our blog.

    <section id="qoc">
        <h2>QOC</h2>
        <p>
            Also we need to create use the QOC (Questions, Options and Criteria) methodology for this project, where we
            asked questions regarding design key issues, we reviewed possible options to response to each question, and
            we set an evaluation criteria concerning every option. An example in our case would be:
            <cite>Can all users get the generated diagrams from our application?</cite> And the options and criterias are:
            <cite>Option 1: Yes.</cite>
            <cite>Criteria 1: Anyone that accesses the app and wants to use the generated diagram for the selected data can get the code for the diagram.</cite>
            <cite>Criteria 2: Anyone that access the app and wants to use the generated diagram can copy the image</cite>
            <cite>Option 2: No.</cite>
            They full list of QOCs are available on

    <section id="implementation">
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            For the implementation of this project we decided to use a classical client/server architecture, where we use
            the server side to import the data from various sources like CSV and excel files that will be downloaded from
            different data providers, and then parse and process it into usable JSON format that will be send to our
            client application. Regarding the technology we used Symfony PHP framework for the server side, and on the
            front-end we developed out application with AngularJS.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="user-testing">
        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <p>
            We also did some research on user testing, and created a test scenario, in which we ask the evaluated user
            to do the following things: access the application, select a food category, apply filters and visualize/download
            data from diagram. Regarding the persons that will test the application, we asked some of our colleagues from
            work to help us. They were perfect fit, because they represent the primary persona type - technical users,
            which are interested in food and diet. The list of tasks that they have to accomplish are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access application and select category - 30 seconds;</li>
            <li>Access filter menu and select filters (understand relation between selecting a filter and the showed result) - 45 seconds;</li>
            <li>Apply filter to view the nutritional value for 3 favourite food types - 2 minutes;</li>
            <li>Change diagram type to have a different visualisation for the data - 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Download diagram and save it locally on the computer - 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Access settings page and change font option - 20 seconds</li>
            <li>Change color them to a dark one - 20 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our main objectives for user testing are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary goal is to improve the usability of a product.</li>
            <li>Identify how intuitive are the filtering controls, for a user that sees them first time.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the positioning on page and the interaction that the user will have with the menus, filters and diagrams.</li>
            <li>Observe user capacity to understand how filters work and the capacity un understand data from diagrams.</li>
            <li>Observe user response to the color palette and scheme.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also completed a <a href="http://foodcharts.vrinceanu.com/usability-testing/">Usability Test Plan Template</a> which was available on the course page.</p>

    <section id="accessibility-report">
        <h2>Accessibility Report</h2>
        <p>
            For the accessibility report, we user the guidelines from <a href="https://www.w3.org/">w3.org</a> that are
            detailed in this article: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>.
            And we used the tool available at this link <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/">www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/</a>
            in order to generate a report about the accessibility solutions that were implemented in our application.

    <section typeof="sa:Conclusion" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            We consider that we manage to learn a lot of things about the field of <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/index.html">Human-Computer Interaction course</a>
            and that we tried to make the final deliverables as good as we can. We learned about: design patterns,
            etymology and branding, personas, QOCs, sketches/wireframes/prototypes, storyboards, usability testing
            and accessibility. Of course that there is plenty of space for improvements, especially regarding the
            implementation, but we consider that we manage to make an idea about what benefits can have a proper study
            about the Human-Computer link.
